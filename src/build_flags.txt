# Argument explanations:
DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS: A double-quoted string is expected for this flag (space-separated list of flags)
DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE: This project assumes that vcpkg is installed and that it's used to manage dependencies
DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET: The target platform for vcpkg

# Increases binary sizes, but removes the need for shared libraries
Add to DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:
  - "-static-libgcc" 
  - "-static-libstdc++" 

# For vcpkg integration, include the following in your CMake arguments:
# 1. Replace [[platform]] with the target platform
# 2. Replace [[vcpkg_dir]] with the path to your vcpkg directory (make sure it has cmake installed)
-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=[[vcpkg_dir]]\scripts\buildsystems\vcpkg.cmake
-DVCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET=[[platform]]

# For step-by-step debugging, add the following to CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:
Add to DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS:
  - "-O0"
